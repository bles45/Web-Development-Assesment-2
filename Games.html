      <p>My first game project this academic year I completed was a game that would help portray what it is like to life with a modern controversial issue which happened to be about media addiction. I decided to call the game "Jaded", to reflect the inner mental conflict that is within the mindset of an addict.

  <!-- Second Game Project -->

    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <p>My second game project this academic year is called Sorcery and Steel: the Edge of Fate is a two-player fighting game with asymmetrical mechanics, set in a fantasy world on the brink of destruction. You’ll play as either a wizard bent on the world’s destruction, who is trying to use their extreme telekinetic power to call a meteor from the sky, or a near-unstoppable knight sworn to end the wizard before this can be done. This was a collaberated group project where I was the main designer for characters, assets and backgrounds.
