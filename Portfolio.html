      <p>I'm Blessing. I am a current BSc (Hons) undergraduate degree - a single honours third-year student studying creative computing at Bath Spa University.
        I aspire to do concept art/design for a well-established games studio or business. My skills are primarily self-taught but have been deemed adequate by my lecturers and peers, and I'm ambitious to learn more. I also have multiple hobbies that will be relevant to this field and potentially others similar to this.

    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <p>My first game project this academic year I completed was a game that would help portray what it is like to life with a modern controversial issue which happened to be about media addiction. I decided to call the game "Jaded", to reflect the inner mental conflict that is within the mindset of an addict.

      <p>My second game project this academic year is called Sorcery and Steel: the Edge of Fate is a two-player fighting game with asymmetrical mechanics, set in a fantasy world on the brink of destruction. You’ll play as either a wizard bent on the world’s destruction, who is trying to use their extreme telekinetic power to call a meteor from the sky, or a near-unstoppable knight sworn to end the wizard before this can be done. This was a collaberated group project where I was the main designer for characters, assets and backgrounds.
